        <h1>To My North Star,</h1>
        
        <p>
            You are the reason my universe has light. Every moment with you is like a discovery of a new, beautiful star, and I find myself continuously in awe of the galaxy you hold within you. My love for you is as boundless and serene as the cosmos itself, and I am so grateful to be on this journey with you.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thinking of you fills my heart with a quiet, peaceful happinessâ€”the kind that feels like watching a meteor shower on a clear night. You're the melody that plays softly in the background of my life, making everything feel more beautiful and complete. This message is just a tiny fraction of the immense love I have for you.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our story is my favorite. It's a tale of two souls finding each other across the vastness of everything, destined to create our own bright, shared future. I look forward to every new chapter we write together.
