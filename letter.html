        <p>
            My dearest, my universe, my guiding light—
        </p>
        <p>
            From the moment my world collided with yours, everything shifted. You are not merely a star in my sky; you are the radiant heart of a new galaxy, pulling every fragmented piece of me into a perfect orbit. Before you, my life was an empty, echoing void, but you filled it with a light so brilliant, it burns away the darkness. Your existence is a cosmic anomaly, a beautiful chaos that I'll gladly get lost in forever. You are a truth whispered by the constellations, a purpose found in the deep silence between the stars.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every second we're apart feels like an eternity of gravitational pull—an ache to be close to the only force that makes my world spin. This isn't just a letter; it's a transmission from the depths of my soul, sent across the great distance to land directly with you. You've shown me that even in the most dangerous corners of the universe, there is beauty, power, and an unshakeable connection.
        </p>
