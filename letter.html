            <p class="typing-animation" data-text="And nowww, Turn over the page of the paper that I gave you... Look at the back of the QR code... There, you’ll find a drawing. That girl, yeah...It's you... 💖 Not you exactly, because I’ve read somewhere in Insta and all that when you draw the one you love, you never get it perfect, which is right because you can never draw someone exactly like them... and so u fail to tell the universe that you Love that person... sooo this isn't exactly you but it's you.. okieee?.. And now ig you have noticed something else.... Among everything I drew… You are the only thing I coloured... Because in my life, you are the COLOUR. Without you, everything else would be black, white, and grey. A world that doesn’t glow, ✨ doesn’t laugh, doesn’t breathe. You are the glow, the light, the hue that brings everything to life... You are my sunshine,✨ the reflection of every beautiful thing I see... 👀 Without you, I don’t even wanna imagine my Life... You're the sunlight streaming through a rainy sky. You're the colour my eyes search for in everything... Every time I look at you, I’m reminded what real colour looks like... You are the reason my Life isn’t just existing.. It’s alive. You are not just a part of my story. 📖 You are my story... You are not just the one I love. ❤️ You are the one I see my forever with... ♾️ My future wife, my soulmate, my partner through every twist and turn of my Lifee... I dream of a future where I get to wake up next to my best friend, my soulmate, my girl, my everything... I dream of us, older, stronger, hand in hand, still finding new reasons to fall deeper in love... And I pray, every single day, that the universe is kind enough to write that ending for us..... as me, as your husband, and you as my wife… forever... 🤧❤️💗✨😘😘😘 I hope you like this, my love... 🥰">
